I did not take my life. I survived the moment where I was my most lethal enemy. But whenever I try to tell people about what happened, they don’t seem to understand where my desire to end the pain would come from, unless they also have fought mental health battles. The power of depression is remarkable. It can effectively convince you that despite your connections, your family, your ability, or your friends, you are worthless and alone in the world, that you will never be loveable, and that your existence is a colossal mistake. I want others who don’t battle depression to understand that you will never be able to tell that someone is depressed just by looking at them. I hid my struggle so well that my own family, a loving, wonderful support system, were blindsided. Making the disease invisible was a personal pride of mine, because then I could convince the world that I was not weak or pathetic.
The stereotypes of people with depression are extensive. They range from people not being able to get out of bed, shower, eat, or leave their house. And while these are definite truths for some people, depression is like snowflakes: No two are the same. My depression has its own ways of manifesting itself in my behaviours and thoughts. But someone else’s could be the polar opposite. Which makes neither more or less valid than the other.
In all honesty, I’ve rarely been asked to explain what depression means to me. You say the word and people either turn away in fear or they try to relate in attempts to console and/or fill the silence. When really, all I need is for someone to ask “And how does depression affect you?”.Depression, for me, is another soul taking over my mind and body. It cohabits day in day out in attempts to knock my confidence, whispering insults in my ear. And I can live with this; I know it is a part of me and I’m grateful to merely exist – so if I have to share with depression then so be it.
The struggle comes when depression really takes over, and I forget my strength, vitality and the love I have for those around me. Every word, action, or passing glance is an attack. My body aches and all I want to do is sleep until the pain goes away. If someone tries to ask me how I’m feeling or what’s going on in my head, I can’t answer them. I become so overwhelmed by the pure negativity that I shut down to protect myself.In the first few years, my coping mechanism was self-harm. I didn’t do it to “feel something” or to punish myself. I self-harmed so that the pain would stop – in the brief moments afterwards I felt a sense of calm and control. This was fleeting, and as with any addiction, I needed more of it to achieve the same results. Before long I was hurting myself “just because” and to this day there are months of my life that I cannot remember – my brain has shut off the memories because they are too harmful.
The scars act as a reminder that I may have lost some battles, but I’m winning the war. When strangers stare in confusion, or whisper to their friend who turns in shock – it hurts. I vividly remember parties when other girls would gather, laughing and pointing – the world can be a cruel place. But when someone approaches me with kindness and asks about my scars, I feel hopeful, and explain that “I have depression and that’s how I used to cope, but I’m okay now”.
Depression makes me feel worthless, insignificant and burdensome, I won't ask you for help, because I don't have the strength. Please could you sit down with me, and let me know that you are 'here'? I might not be able to talk about feelings, but ask "how do you feel today?" and I'd know that you care.Please don't be offended when I don't respond - sometimes the only way of coping is to shut you, and everything else, out. I might snap back at you, or say "I'm fine"; when we both know that's not true. Stay with me, even in silence, tears, anger and irritation - don't ask "Why? What? How? When?" Just tell me you're here when I'm ready to talk, and maybe one day I can.
Many people might think of a period of poor mental health as being incapable of getting out of bed in the morning, or a severe lack of motivation and reluctance to do anything. Certainly, for many people these symptoms are prominent at times.Unfortunately, because they seem perfectly ‘normal’ on the outside, when they choose to be open about their mental health, they’re often met with the phrase, ‘you can’t be dealing with that much if you’re still able to get out of bed in the morning’.A terribly frustrating sentence that I, as someone who is high-functioning, and others with similar conditions hear far too often. Although I’m sure (well, I hope!) these comments aren’t intended to cause harm, and likely descend from ignorance around mental health in general, they really need to stop.
people won't always know if you're struggling. Sometimes it feels like being silent is the only viable option. After all, why would you want to burden someone else with your problems?When I was at sixth form college, I found it hard to balance college assignments with my part-time work. Evening and weekend shifts were taking up a lot of free time. I was burning myself out. The anxiety around achieving the right grades for uni was making me stressed. My workplace was not supportive when it came to my mental health challenges. Feeling depressed wasn't a choice. It was a natural reaction to my personal circumstances.I asked them to write this because I found it embarrassing to be honest about the true nature of my illness. My line manager scoffed when they saw "stress" on my sick note. How could someone of my age feel stressed?
I ended up dropping out of college during the second year. At this moment in time, it wasn't right for me.It wasn't until a few years after when I moved on from my part-time job and started an apprenticeship in the public sector. This was a different experience. I found it easier discussing my personal circumstances with my new line manager. My circumstances included ongoing domestic abuse, and long-term consequences from historic abuse. This was affecting my performance at work, and even my ability to arrive on-time. I ended up sharing a lot with my line manager over the course of my apprenticeship.
I spent a lot of my adolescence numbing the pain. I'd get wasted most nights, it meant I didn't have to face the reality of my existence and the 1001 thoughts running through my head would be temporarily slowed down. I was on top of the world, the sadness and pain would be pushed down but then the hangover would kick in.
I actually did try to reach out for help. I remember standing in front of the people who society tells you would help you no matter what and saying what I did and why. The response: uncomfortable glances and shifting and "You shouldn't do that". Then it was buried and to this day no one has ever mentioned it. Once, I asked to see a counsellor and even went to the doctors to get the ball rolling. But because I felt completely unsupported and isolated from those closest to me I couldn’t go through with it.
Those experiences made me feel ashamed and that I had to keep my mouth shut. I felt that I should never burden others with my problems or make them uncomfortable. I was made to feel that someone more important had it worse than me and they were the priority and I was the problem.I remember feeling terrified whilst uttering the words and terrified that someone knew my secret. I learnt to smile on the outside and fall apart on the inside. And no, I was not an addict. I only did this when my illness showed up, hung about and refused to leave. I was self-destructive and thought I deserved what was happening to me.Mental illness stigma can make things worse for those struggling and can delay or impede them getting the help they need. The misconceptions still exist that people with mental health problems are dangerous, violent, criminal and unable to live a "normal" life. The media often doesn't help with these views either.
I convinced myself my fear of food was nothing to worry about, purely because of the internalised stigma I had surrounding eating disorders. I thought eating disorders couldn’t happen to people like me, much less deserve help when they were suffered by people like me. When I thought of anorexia, I thought of young, white, skinny teenage girls who took a diet too far and landed themselves in hospital. While that may be one story, it is one of millions. And somewhere in the millions of stories is mine.When I became ill with anorexia, I was not trying out a diet. I did not make a decision one day to just ‘stop eating’. I didn’t ever go to hospital. When I became ill with anorexia, it was a way of coping. I was extremely depressed, although didn’t know this at the time. My home life was unstable, and I clung to this illness with all I had. I did all I could to ensure my family didn’t notice, and although my school friends noticed, they said nothing. They were too blinded by their own idea of what an eating disorder looked like, and dismissed mine for a long time. After a year or so I realised I had a problem, but still didn’t believe I was sick enough to seek help.
I was praised by my friends for my willpower to exercise every day without fail and never touch junk food. I looked a healthy weight, was technically a ‘healthy weight’ (whatever that means), and yet I would faint whilst working out and fall over if I stood up too quickly. I looked healthy and yet I was a shell of a person, whose life revolved around calorie counting and obsessively exercising. I have vivid memories of my legs shaking as I walked into the exam hall to do my GCSEs - not because I was anxious, but because every step further took energy my body no longer had. All I could think about was food. At my lowest, I was suicidal, self-harming, spending weeks in bed. It was a time of my life that is so odd to think about because I was not myself at all. The memories are so vivid but they don’t feel like they are my own. I was really, very lost. What has stuck with me, this entire time, is this feeling of invalidity. This feeling of not being ‘sick enough’.
It's been two years since I have self-harmed, but not a day since I haven't fought with my own thoughts and felt exhausted after playing the part each and every day. I have since told some of my colleagues and those who have understood have made me want to be here longer. My best friends who call just to see how I am doing that day, have made the worst days bearable by making me feel safe to talk. My mental health disorders haven't vanished and still cause me no end of pain, but I can finally see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.
But over time, I started having extremely bad anxiety and was becoming more depressed. School was using the little effort I had left. I gave up all my after-school clubs, all sporting events. I wouldn't eat at school or at home.After a few months, I reached out to my friends about what was happening. But sadly, at that time they just came out with remarks about how I was being ungrateful and it was all for attention.I felt extremely judged. Their comments made me feel worse.I started self-harming and had suicidal thoughts. I was angry at myself, at everyone. I felt isolated even though I was sat with a big group of friends each day.By the beginning of next summer I had hit rock bottom. I kept thinking that suicide would be a way out whenever something bad happened.
Suddenly, everything had changed, and each subsequent day felt increasingly torturous. Although, I believe people in my life suspected something was wrong, for a long time no one asked me what was going on in a way I felt able to answer.
Looking back, now aged 21, I can see that this was partly due to the fact I was terribly ashamed that I wasn't able to 'just get on with things' in the way I thought many of my peers did. I decided it was easier to say I was fine, than attempt to explain what I was feeling. After all, I had no idea what was really wrong, so how could I possibly explain it to someone else who doesn't really seem to have the time of day? One teacher demanded to know why my grades had dropped, and when I couldn't find the words, they told me I wasn't working hard enough; another told me they were sick of my excuses: they said it was "disappointing". And I wondered, if the adults in my life thought this, then what would my friends think? I heard words like 'mental', 'crazy', and 'psycho' being used in the most derogatory way in every day classroom chatter. So, I was silent, and this carried on for months.
I know how self-debilitating it can get and feeling like you don’t have anyone to talk to. You’re afraid that if you let your guard down people will think that you’re weak, you don’t want to be vulnerable only to be left as a prisoner of your own mind, trapped with your demons, questioning your worth after giving away your secrets to people who you thought would be there forever. It’s not always easy to ask someone about their mental health and don’t ask if you’re not prepared to listen and will brush it off.
The nagging thought that something isn't right. I was deeply unhappy. It was only Christmas Day afternoon that I found myself at peace. As a family we were all enjoying time together.The 27th of December I was back at work, this will help, I thought, the job keeps me busy and focused. Then the thumping heart beat would start. Anxiety? Why? Stupidly I ignored it. I began to feel sorry for myself, and it began to manifest in to something much darker.New year, new start. Yup pretty much, but not a new start I'd wish on anyone. Looking back now it all seems so clear. I was irritable, looking to pick fights, writing incendiary tweets to get the reaction I wanted. Bad vibes.
The days passed and I became focused on finding a way out of my darkness. This is the bit I find hardest to write, but I feel it needs to be put out there, for people to understand it can happen, and something can be done to stop it.I began to Google ways to end my life. I began planning when would be the best time to do it. I knew it would destroy people's lives so what date would be the best to lessen the impact years down the line. My heart is thumping as I write this now. It's a matter of when, not if. I needed out, I couldn't see my life improving, or even staying the same. It was getting worse.Thankfully I slipped up, something totally unrelated to my own battles opened the flood gates. My reckless nature almost destroyed the woman I love. It all came rushing out. How I'd felt for weeks, how quickly those feelings developed, my worries and stresses, my plan to end it all. My wife was destroyed, she'd heard it before, other than attempting to take my own life. I couldn't do this to her over and over again, my brain was screaming "get out, get out now, there's no way back". Mrs G had other ideas, basically calling me an idiot. Putting others before my own mental health. Home truths. They hurt but everything was brought in to a very sharp focus.
